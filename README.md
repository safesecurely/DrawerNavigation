# DrawerNavigation
Expo-Router with Drawer Navigation, Tabs and Typescript.  Testing, understanding and explaining the functionality - following the Expo-Router documentation.

The Drawer basically has it's own layout and only allows the files in the same directory to be used as links.  In order to add other links, the documentation seems to be unclear.  Especially if combining both tabs and drawer navigation, there seems to be a lack of guidance on combining them easily.

Was not sure how to get this integrated - so started a new typescript project with navigation: 

```npx create-expo-app@latest DrawerNavigation --template```

then followed the docs to implement Drawer navigation.

## Basically needed to follow:
1. Drawer navigation | Expo Router (https://expo.github.io/router/docs/migration/react-navigation/drawer-navigator/)
2. Drawer | Expo Router (https://expo.github.io/router/docs/migration/react-navigation/drawer/)

- [ ] TODO 1: Add the rest of your notes later.  Consider adding Auth as well, so you have functioning Expo Router project with Drawer Navigation, Tabs, and Auth implemented.
- [ ] TODO 2: Implement Firebase or Amplify Auth.
- [ ] TODO 3: Implement Testing Framework - ideally Automated with a Monitoring Solution.
